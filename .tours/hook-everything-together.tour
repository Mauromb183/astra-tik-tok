Set the data as users instead of posts this time.\n\nUse an Effect hook and invoke addData and fetchData, and return an empty array for now.\n\nAdd the following code to const addData. This enables you to POST to your database using the addData Netlify function.  It also:\n* Sets up descendingUsers and topFiveFollowing to use with the different cards\n* Calls the addData endpoint to add data to the system\n* Fetches data from the 'post' endpoint to populate the page"
