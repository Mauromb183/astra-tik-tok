To get data in, you are going to create a serverless function. For this, you are going to use Netlify and Netlify functions. This means that it is not necessary to write a server, everything can be done with Netlify functions. Netlify deploys the functions you write as full API endpoints and will even run them automatically in response to events. If you haven't heard of Netlify functions before, this is a good place to start.  If you want to read more about Netlify, visit the [Getting Started documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/)."
